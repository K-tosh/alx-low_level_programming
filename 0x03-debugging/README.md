# 0x03.C -Debugging

This repository contains the solutions for the debugging tasks in the ALX Low Level Programming curriculum. The main goal of this project is to help you understand the concepts and processes of debugging manually.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:

- Explain what debugging is
- Describe different methods of debugging manually
- Understand how to read error messages

## Tasks

The repository is organized as follows:

- `0x03-debugging`: This directory contains the solutions for the debugging tasks.
    - `0-main.c`: Test file for the `positive_or_negative()` function.
    - `main.h`: Header file for the `positive_or_negative()` function.
    - `1-main.c`: Test file for the infinite loop code.
    - `2-main.c`: Test file for the `largest_number()` function.
    - `2-largest_number.c`: Implementation of the `largest_number()` function.
    - `3-main_a.c`: Test file for the date conversion code.
    - `3-main_b.c`: Test file for the leap year case in the date conversion code.
    - `3-convert_day.c`: Implementation of the `convert_day()` function.
    - `3-print_remaining_days.c`: Implementation of the `print_remaining_days()` function.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All files should end with a new line
- Code should use the Betty style, which will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

Please note that plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program. You are expected to come up with your own solutions for the tasks.
